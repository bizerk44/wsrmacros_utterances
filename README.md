Utterances is a set of macros for windows speech recognition that uses short, quick nonsense words to perform keystrokes that are slow and error-prone with the default grammar. The project is based largely on a demo by Travis Rudd (link to be posted) in his video on coding Python by voice. The goal is to make a speech recognition quicker, more efficient and more practical for more complex computer usage, such as programming or document editing. 

Examples below

Instead of "press open left angle bracket" say "larb"

Instead of "delete the last word" say "deword"

Instead of "press down arrow key" say "darrow"

The resulting commands can sound admittedly ridiculous, but are far quicker and easier than the default commands and can significantly reduce the time necessary to code by voice.

To use utterances, you must have WSRMacros installed.
